# What is WEEB token?

WEEB token is the worlds first non-custodial staking token!

Unlike traditional staking where you're required to give the custody (ownership) of your tokens to a secondary or a third party contract, with WEEB staking is an intrinsic feature.
Holding your tokens in an externally owned account (EOA, an account controlled by a private key) is enough to generate passive income. With WEEB you're always staking ($, âˆž) and earning.

Decentralized Finance (DeFi) presents a unique opportunity to people by providing access to variety of financial products thus financial freedom to more people.

Due to the diversity of the products and vastness of the space the investor has to constanly study the new products, learn their details, understand the risks, the constraints etc. which are sometimes not very well documented or not documented at all or simply confusing.
That increases the learning curve of making an investment and puts the investor in limbo state where either they don't invest or invest blindly.

## Not in your wallet, not your money

In traditional staking for the investor to generate passive income they have to transfer their tokens to a seperate staking contract. This means *giving up the ownership* of the actual tokens in exchange of a potential return.

Although, the investor can see their staked amount and the potential reward ***there is difference between accessing and owning your tokens***.
Since the tokens are in the custody of the staking contract potential unwanted situations like unabling to withdraw before the lock up time, being charged for an earlier withdrawal, long unstaking periods of several days or longer, can arise when the investor tries to withdraw their tokens.
As a matter of fact, this can be done quite simply since the staking contract owns the tokens the investor is bound by the rules of the code. Isn't it a little disturbing?

This is not the financial freedom we're dreaming about.
Knowing that, we designed WEEB to generate passive income without the requirement to transfer your tokens out from your wallet. You start to earn right away. You own your tokens and it is up to you to do whatever your want with them and whenever your want it.
